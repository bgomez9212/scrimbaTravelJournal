Aiming for a zero emissions arena. Cool things around the arena like the plant wall, lots of food options and the metal cups for beverages.",

Place had a personality and the fans brought a culture. Specialty foods and cocktails, and commemorative cups. Great soundtrack too. Favorite arena I've been to.",
